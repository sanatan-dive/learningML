# What Deep Learning is Good For

- **Problems with long lists of rules** — When the traditional approach fails, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) may help. DL can automatically learn patterns from data without needing explicit rule-based programming.
    
- **Continually changing environments** — Deep learning can adapt (learn) to new scenarios and update its models as new data becomes available.
    
- **Discovering insights within large collections of data** — Can you imagine trying to hand-craft rules for what 101 different kinds of food look like? DL can automatically extract features and classify data at scale.

# What Deep Learning is Not Good For

- **When you need explainability** — Deep learning models, especially deep neural networks, are often considered "black boxes" because their decision-making process is hard to interpret.
    
- **When the traditional approach is a better option** — If a simple rule-based system or traditional algorithm can solve the problem efficiently, there’s no need for DL.
    
- **When errors are unacceptable** — In critical applications like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving, even small errors can have severe consequences. DL models may not always be reliable in such cases.
    
- **When you don’t have much data** — Deep learning typically requires large amounts of labeled data to perform well. With limited data, traditional ML or simpler models may be more effective.

# ML vs DL

- **Structured data in ML** — Machine learning often works well with structured data (e.g., tables, spreadsheets) where features are well-defined and organized.
    
- **Unstructured data in DL** — Deep learning excels with unstructured data like images, audio, text, and video, where patterns are complex and not easily defined by handcrafted features.

# What Are Neural Networks?

- **Neural networks** are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transform input data to produce an output.
    
- **Key components**:
    
    - **Input layer**: Receives the initial data.
        
    - **Hidden layers**: Intermediate layers that extract features and learn patterns.
        
    - **Output layer**: Produces the final result (e.g., classification, prediction).
        
- **Activation functions**: Introduce non-linearity to help the network learn complex patterns (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).
    
- **Training**: Neural networks learn by adjusting weights and biases through backpropagation and optimization algorithms like gradient descent.
    
- **Types of neural networks**:
    
    - **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)**: Basic architecture where data flows in one direction.
        
    - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Specialized for image and video data.
        
    - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Designed for sequential data like time series or text.
        
    - **Transformers**: Advanced architectures for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

# What is a tensor?# What is a Tensor?

- **A tensor is a generalized form of arrays and matrices**, used to represent data in deep learning and other computational frameworks.
    
- **Think of it as a container for numbers**: Tensors can store scalars, vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional data.
    
- **Key properties**:
    
    - **Rank (or dimensionality)**: The number of dimensions in a tensor.
        
        - Rank 0: Scalar (e.g., `5`).
            
        - Rank 1: Vector (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
            
        - Rank 2: Matrix (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`).
            
        - Rank 3 and above: Higher-dimensional arrays (e.g., `[[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]`).
            
    - **Shape**: The size of each dimension (e.g., a matrix `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` has a shape of `(2, 2)`).
        
    - **Data type**: The type of data stored (e.g., float, int, boolean).
        
- **Why tensors are important**:
    
    - They are the fundamental data structure in deep learning frameworks like **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.
        
    - They enable efficient computation on GPUs/TPUs for tasks like matrix multiplication, convolution, and gradient calculation.
        
- **Example**: In deep learning, an image is often represented as a 3D tensor with shape `(height, width, channels)` (e.g., `(224, 224, 3)` for a color image).

In short, **a tensor is a multi-dimensional array** that helps organize and process data efficiently in machine learning and deep learning.
